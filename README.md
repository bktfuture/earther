## Description

Your mission is to evade all the adversaries that appear. As you progress through each level, the number of enemies will increase, and you'll have a total of three chances to survive. However, you can only utilize one life by correctly answering a question; otherwise, you'll lose, and the game will reset. Good Luck Earther! 

#### Technologies

- Godot is a popular, open-source game engine that is used to create video games across various platforms such as Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and Web. Moreover, Godot provides a visual editor that allows game developers to create and manipulate game objects, scenes, and scripts using a node-based approach. The engine supports multiple programming languages, including GDScript, C#, and C++, and also provides a powerful physics engine and animation system. We used GDScript to create nodes with animated 2D sprites for a user and the colliding objects. 
- We used figma and Canvax
