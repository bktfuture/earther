> We were passionate about creating something that could help the environment, and that's where our inspiration for this game came from. We wanted to develop an exciting game that would not only entertain but also educate players on the importance of environmental conservation.

## Description

Your mission is to evade all the adversaries that appear. As you progress through each level, the number of enemies will increase, and you'll have a total of three chances to survive. However, you can only utilize one life by correctly answering a question; otherwise, you'll lose, and the game will reset. Good Luck Earther! 

#### Technologies

- Godot is a popular, open-source game engine that is used to create video games across various platforms such as Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and Web. Moreover, Godot provides a visual editor that allows game developers to create and manipulate game objects, scenes, and scripts using a node-based approach. The engine supports multiple programming languages, including GDScript, C#, and C++, and also provides a powerful physics engine and animation system. We used GDScript to create nodes with animated 2D sprites for a user and the colliding objects. 
- We used figma and Canvax to create all the designs. 
- Procreate for drawing all the elements.
